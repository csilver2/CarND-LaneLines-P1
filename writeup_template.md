**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps. First, I converted the images to grayscale, then I .... 

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function by ...

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline


One potential shortcoming would be what would happen when ... 

Another shortcoming could be ...


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

A possible improvement would be to ...

Another potential improvement could be to ...

### introduccion. My pipeline has five steps to folow after make lines in the video.

### 1. grayscale, gaussian_blur

first we edit the functions grayscale, and gaussian_blur, in order to make easyer for the canny operation to detect edges in the images:
```
def grayscale(img):
return cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2GRAY) 

def gaussian_blur(img, kernel_size):
    return cv2.GaussianBlur(img, (kernel_size, kernel_size), 0)
```
### 2. canny
```
def canny(img, low_threshold, high_threshold): 
return cv2.Canny(img, low_threshold, high_threshold)
```
### 3. Masked Image
```
def region_of_interest(img, vertices):
    """Applies an image mask."""
    #defining a blank mask to start with
    mask = np.zeros_like(img)   
    
    #defining a 3 channel or 1 channel color to fill the mask with depending on the input image
    if len(img.shape) > 2:
        channel_count = img.shape[2]  # i.e. 3 or 4 depending on your image
        ignore_mask_color = (255,) * channel_count
    else:
        ignore_mask_color = 255
        
    #filling pixels inside the polygon defined by "vertices" with the fill color    
    cv2.fillPoly(mask, vertices, ignore_mask_color)
    
    #returning the image only where mask pixels are nonzero
    masked_image = cv2.bitwise_and(img, mask)
    return masked_image
```
